# Master Degree - Advanced Analysis of Information - Econometrics - Insper

## Machine Learning - Evaluations for Supervised ML Algorithms

This project was built by Tiago Oliveira ~October - December 2013~ [ti.olive@gmail.com](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagoliveira/).

It was developed essencially in Stata language course "Advanced Analysis of Information - Econometrics" in [Insper](https://www.insper.edu.br/pos-graduacao/mestrado/administracao/)

I have here some tests of quantitative data analysis to understand the hypotheses presented in empirical studies using Stata.
